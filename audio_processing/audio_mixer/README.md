important information for mixing-dummyÂ´s like me
================================================
If you're doing lots of audio processing, you might want to represent your audio levels as floating-point values, and only go back to the 16-bit space at the end of the process. High-end digital audio systems often work this way.

"Quieter by half" isn't quite correct. Because of the ear's logarithmic response, dividing the samples in half will make it 6-db quieter - certainly noticeable, but not disastrous.

how to
======

get some RIFF wave files you want to mix together using the algorithms or generate them using the script here:
https://github.com/ruf-telematik-ag/audiocore-dsp/blob/master/test_scripts/sine_wave_generator.py

then run the application mixerapplication with all the wave files as arguments
./mixerapplication samples/*
