fancy search
============
outcome of a really interesting conversation with two friends.
fancy search scans all the man pages on your system and let you search for different terms - as apropos for full man text :)
result not verified...

todo
====
 * man page importer is really slow... i tried with command or os instead of subprocess, same result...
 * index remove / update not implemented
