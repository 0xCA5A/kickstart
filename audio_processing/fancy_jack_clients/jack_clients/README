source: Sing-a-Long Song Devocalizer - make magazine, makezing.com/projects/39 
idea: When songs are mixed from individual tracks,
the waveforms of the isolated instruments and voices are added together to from the left and the right channel of the
stereo mix. Typically, vocal tracks are placed in the center of the mix. which results in mathematically identical waveforms being sent to the left and
the right channels.

Each stereo channel is added to an inverse copy of the opposite channel, canceling any audio that's mixed in both channels.
Result: Vocals magically vanish!
~ 20% of the songs have fantastic vocal cancellation
50% - 60% of the songs, the effect is less pronounced but you still hear instrumental parts you never heard before
About 15% are duds, and 5% have a fantastic, totally unexpected, robotic audio sound that's difficult to describe.
