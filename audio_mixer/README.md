If you're doing lots of audio processing, you might want to represent your audio levels as floating-point values, and only go back to the 16-bit space at the end of the process. High-end digital audio systems often work this way.

"Quieter by half" isn't quite correct. Because of the ear's logarithmic response, dividing the samples in half will make it 6-db quieter - certainly noticeable, but not disastrous.
